**Lab 4. Basic Router Configuration and Securing Admin Access via Console**

**Objective:**
•	Establish a console connection between the PC and the router.
•	Access the router using terminal software on the PC.
•	Configure and secure console access with a password and login authentication.

**Description**

The direct connection to a router involves using a console cable to physically connect a PC and a router, enabling initial access to configure the device without requiring prior network setup. In contrast, using a terminal connection (e.g., SSH or Telnet) requires the router to already have IP connectivity and proper login credentials, allowing remote configuration over a network. The console connection is used for initial setup or troubleshooting when no network access is available, while terminal connections are for ongoing management once the router is configured.
This lab demonstrates the basic configuration of a Cisco router using a console connection. You will configure the router's hostname, set up password protection for privileged EXEC and console access, and verify the changes in the running configuration.

**Steps to Perform**
1.	Connect the PC and Router using a Console Cable:
-	Use an RS-232 cable to connect the PC's serial port to the console port of the router.

2.	Access the Router Terminal:
-	Open terminal software on the PC. 
-	Connect to the router's console.

3.	Change the Hostname of the Router:
-	Enter global configuration mode by typing: config t
-	Change the hostname to R1: host R1

4.	Set a Privileged EXEC Mode Password:
-	Configure a secure password for privileged EXEC mode: enable secret cisco

5.	Configure Console Line Access:
-	Enter console line configuration mode: line console 0
-	Set a console password: password ccna
-	Enable login authentication for the console: login

6.	Exit Privileged EXEC Mode to Test the Configurations:
-	Type exit to log out of privileged EXEC mode.
-	Verify that the router prompts for:
-	Console access password (ccna).
-	Privileged EXEC mode password (cisco).

7.	View the Running Configuration:
-	Verify the configurations made in the router using the command: show running-config
