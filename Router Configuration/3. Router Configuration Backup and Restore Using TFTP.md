**Lab 3. Router Configuration Backup and Restore Using TFTP**

**Objective:**
-	Backup Configuration from Router to TFTP Server.
-	Restore Configuration to Another Router.

**Description**

TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) is a simple file transfer protocol used to transfer files between devices over a network. It is commonly used in network environments to backup and restore configuration files for network devices, including Cisco routers and switches.

**In this lab, we will:**
-	Configure a router (R1) and set up a TFTP server to store its configuration.
-	Use the copy running-config tftp command to save the router’s configuration to the TFTP server.
-	Restore the saved configuration from the TFTP server to another router (R2) using the copy tftp: running-config command.

**Steps to Perform**

1.	Initial Setup:
-	Take one router (R1) and one TFTP server.
-	Assign an IP address to the router interface and the TFTP server.

2.	Router Configuration:
-	Perform basic configurations on the router to demonstrate the backup process:
-	Enable service password encryption: service password-encryption.
-	Set a description for the interface: description "Router Backup".
-	Change the router name: hostname R1.
-	Configure an IP address for the router interface.
-	Save the configuration using the command: wr

3.	Backup Configuration to TFTP Server in R1 Router:
-	Use the following command to copy the running configuration file from R1 to the TFTP server: copy running-config tftp

-	Follow the prompts:
-	Enter the TFTP server’s IP address.
-	Specify the destination file name (e.g., R1_Backup).

-	Verify the backup file on the TFTP server under its services (you should see the R1_Backup file).

4.	Restore Configuration to Another Router (R2):
-	Take another router (R2) and configure its interface with a different IP address to communicate with the TFTP server.
-	Adjust the default gateway on the TFTP server to ensure communication with R2.
-	Restore the configuration using the command on R2: copy tftp: running-config

-	Follow the prompts:
-	Enter the source file name (e.g., R1_Backup).
-	For the destination file name, simply press Enter.

-	Verify the running configuration on R2 to ensure the settings from R1 are restored.
