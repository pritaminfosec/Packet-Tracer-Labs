**Lab 2. Renaming the Router and Enabling the Password for CLI Access**

**Objective:**
1.	Set the router password in three ways: Simple, Encrypted, and Secret.
2.	View the running and startup configurations.
3.	Save the configuration.

**Description**

In this lab, we need to rename the router hostname and enable the password, ensuring that only the admin can access the Privileged EXEC mode of the router. There are two ways to encrypt the password: Service Password Encryption and Enable Secret. 

**Steps to Perform**

1.	Set Up Routers: We have two routers, R1 and R2.
2.	Change Router Name:
-	To change the router name from Router to R1, follow these steps:
	Enter Privileged EXEC mode.
	Then, enter Global Configuration mode.
	Type hostname R1. The router's hostname will now change to R1.

3.	Set Router Password:
-	To set a simple password for the router, use the command: enable password cisco.
-	After exiting Global Configuration mode and re-entering Privileged EXEC mode, the router will prompt you for the password.

4.	Check Running Configuration:
-	You can check the running configuration to verify that the password has been set.
-	Note: The password will be in plaintext and visible to anyone viewing the configuration.

5.	Encrypt Password:
-	To encrypt the password, use the command: service password-encryption.
-	After applying this command, the password will no longer appear in plaintext in the running configuration. However, this encryption is not highly secure, as attackers can still crack this type of encryption.

6.	Remove Password Encryption:
-	To cancel or delete password encryption, use the command: no service password-encryption.
-	Note: If you check the running configuration now, the password will still be shown in the encrypted format. The encryption will be removed and applied only to the next password set.

7.	Set Enable Secret Password:
-	To configure a more secure password (enable secret), use the command: enable secret ccna.
-	Note: This is a different password from the one set with enable password, and it will be stored in an encrypted format in the running configuration.

8.	Save Configuration:
-	To save the configuration, use the command: write memory or wr.
