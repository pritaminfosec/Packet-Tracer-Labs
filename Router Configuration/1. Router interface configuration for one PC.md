**Lab 1. Router interface configuration for one PC**

**Objective:**
1. Assign a static IP address to PC1 as 191.168.1.2 and set the default gateway to the router's IP address, 191.168.1.1.
2. Assign the IP address 191.168.1.1 to the router's GigabitEthernet 0/0/0 interface as the default gateway.
3. Save the configuration and reload the router to apply the changes.
4. Send a ping request from the router to PC1 and from PC1 to the router to test connectivity.

**Description**
**+ About Router Interface -> **
An interface in a router is a physical or virtual connection point used to connect the router to a network or other devices. Interfaces can be physical ports (Ethernet, FastEthernet, GigabitEthernet) or logical (sub-interfaces, loopbacks). They enable communication between networks and devices. Routers do not have a single IP address. Each interface has its own unique IP address to represent its connection to a specific network. This allows the router to distinguish between different networks.
For this lab, the key configurations are the PC's IP address and the PC's default gateway. The PC's IP address should be set to 191.168.1.2, and the default gateway should be set to 191.168.1.1. When assigning the IP address to the GigabitEthernet 0/0/0 interface on the router, the IP address should be set to the default gateway IP address, which is 191.168.1.1. If an incorrect IP address is assigned to the router's interface, you can remove it using the no ip address command.
Steps to Perform

1.	Adding Router and Server in Packet Tracer
-	Add one Router and one PC in Packet Tracer for connectivity testing.

2.	Assigning Static IP Address to PC
-	Assign a static IP address to PC1:
	IPv4 Address: 191.168.1.2
	Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1

3.	Enter Privileged EXEC Mode
-	To enter Privileged EXEC mode, type: en

4.	Enter Global Configuration Mode
-	To configure the router's IP address, enter Global Configuration mode: conf t
-	Now, you are in global configuration mode.

5.	View Router Interfaces
-	To see a brief overview of all interfaces on the router, use the following command: do sh ip int br
-	This will display a list of all interfaces on the router.

6.	Assign IP Address to Router Interface
-	The server is connected to GigabitEthernet 0/0/0 on the router. We need to assign an IP address to this interface.
-	Enter GigabitEthernet 0/0/0 interface configuration mode: int gig 0/0/0
-	Assign the IP address to the interface: ip address 191.168.1.1 255.255.0.0

7.	Verify Interface IP Address
-	To verify that the IP address has been assigned correctly, you can check the interface again: do sh ip int br
-	The IP address should now appear for the GigabitEthernet 0/0/0 interface.

8.	Enable the Interface
-	By default, most interfaces are administratively shut down when the device is powered on or configured. To bring the interface up, use the following command: no shutdown
-	After running this command, the status of the interface should show as "up".

9.	Save the Configuration and Reload the Router
-	Save the configuration to prevent losing it after a reboot: write memory
-	Optionally, reload the router if needed: reload

10.	Check Connectivity
-	To verify the connectivity between the router and PC1, send ping requests from both ends:
-	Ping from PC1 to the router.

-	Ping from the router to PC1.

-	If both pings are successful and replies are received from both ends, the connectivity is established.

11.	Troubleshooting IP Address Configuration
-	If you accidentally assigned the wrong IP address to the router interface, you can remove the incorrect IP address using the following command: no ip address
-	Enter the interface where the incorrect IP address was assigned, and type the command to remove the IP address.
