**Lab 5. Configuring DHCP on a Router and Verifying Device Connectivity**

**Objective:**
-	Configure a router with a hostname and IP address for the interface.
-	Create a DHCP pool on the router for automatic IP address assignment.
-	Verify that devices receive IP addresses dynamically and test network connectivity.

**Description**

This lab demonstrates how to configure a DHCP server on a router to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices on a network. You will set up the router with a static IP address, create a DHCP pool for IP address allocation, and verify network connectivity. 
What is DHCP and Why Do We Need It?
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) automates the assignment of IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and other network parameters to devices on a network.

**Why We Need DHCP**
1.	Simplified Configuration: DHCP eliminates the need for manual configuration of IP addresses on individual devices.
2.	Efficient Management: It ensures unique IP addresses are assigned to devices without duplication, reducing errors.
3.	Scalability: DHCP is particularly useful in networks with many devices, as it automates the entire process.

**Steps to Perform**
Step 1: Configure the Router
1.	Access the router in privileged mode and enter global configuration: conf t
2.	Change the router hostname to DHCP: host DHCP
3.	Assign an IP address to the GigabitEthernet 0/0/0 interface: int Gig 0/0/0
- ip add 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
- no shut

Step 2: Configure DHCP on the Router
4.	Create a DHCP pool named guest: ip dhcp pool guest
5.	Specify the default gateway (router address): default-router 192.168.1.1
6.	Define the network range for the DHCP pool: network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
7.	Save the configuration: do wr

8.	quickly view the DHCP-related configuration within the running configuration file: do sh run | sec dhcp

Filters the output of sh run to display only the sections of the configuration that include the word "dhcp."
 
Step 3: Configure a PC for DHCP
8.	On a PC, go to the IP configuration settings and enable DHCP.
-	The PC will automatically receive an IP address from the router's DHCP pool.

Step 4: Verify Connectivity
9.	Test connectivity by pinging the router (default gateway): ping 192.168.1.1
10.	Test connectivity between PCs by pinging their dynamically assigned IP addresses.
 
I attempted the same DHCP configuration for two switches that belong to different networks. For this setup, we use two router interfaces with the IP addresses 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.2.1. To ensure these IP addresses are not assigned to any devices by DHCP, we need to exclude them from the DHCP pool. To achieve this, we use the following commands:
-	ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.1
-	ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.2.1

Then Continue the DHCP configuration: Proceed with configuring DHCP pools as usual.
