**Lab 1. Connecting different devices using Copper-Cross-Over and Copper-Straight-Through**

PC transmits data on Pin1 and Pin2 & receives data on Pin 3 and Pin 6.
Switches transmit data on Pin 3 and Pin6 & receive data on Pin 1 and Pin 2.
   
**When to Use Crossover Cable:**

Direct connections between two similar devices (e.g., PC to PC, switch to switch, router to router, PC to server). Both a PC and a server have similar Ethernet interfaces (they are both considered "end devices" in network terms), so a crossover cable is needed to properly align the transmit and receive signals between them.

**When to Use Straight-Through Cable:**
- Connecting different types of devices, like:.
- PC to Switch, PC to Router, Router to Switch, PC to Hub.
